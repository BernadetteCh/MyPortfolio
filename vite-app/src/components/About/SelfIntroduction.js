export const selfIntroduction1 = `Hallo, my name is Bernadette and I am a fullstack software developer
          from Austria. I am always interested in learning new things and
          educate myself. I started learning to code during the pandemic by
          self-study and online workshop of SheCodes, which provides "hands on"
          front-end developer coding workshops.`;
export const selfIntroduction2 = ` Starting exploring a new world was quite exciting so it came that I
          spent more than a year on a coding school in Vienna to built up an
          expertise in different technologies and how to put my own project
          ideas to practice. Besides coding I like to spend my time in the
          nature because it clears my head and it's like balm for the soul . I
          also like to live out my creativity with hyper realistic drawing and
          photography. So it can happen you find me taking pictures on top of a
          mountain or in a restless city, as photography has been a hobby of
          mine for a long time.`;
export const selfIntroduction3 = `  I would say my biggest strength is my courage and one weakness of mine
          is that I am also a detail oriented person so it can happen that I can
          get lost in details. If you like my work or if you would like to give
          feedback, I would be very happy to receive a message.`;
